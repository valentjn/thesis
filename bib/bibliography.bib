  Abstract                 = {A short Matlab implementation for P1-Q1 finite elements on triangles and parallelograms is provided for the numerical solution of elliptic problems with mixed boundary conditions on unstructured grids. According to the shortness of the program and the given documentation, any adaptation from simple model examples to more complex problems can easily beperformed. Numerical examples prove the flexibility of the Matlab tool.},

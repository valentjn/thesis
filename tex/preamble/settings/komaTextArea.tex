% mathdesign's Charter font has some questionable kerning between some
% capital letters such as F, P, and V and a period (the space between those
% is far too small); one solution would be to use the charter package for
% the main text, but that leads a number of other issues (the text size is
% then larger, and doesn't match the math font size anymore...)

\chapter{Algorithms for B-Splines on Sparse Grids}
\footnotetext{\url{https://xkcd.com/163/}}



As we have seen in the last chapter,
hierarchical B-splines constitute an interesting basis on sparse grids,
enabling smooth approximations of objective functions.
When correctly incorporating boundary conditions into the hierarchical basis,
the basis can exactly represent polynomials,
which is a prerequisite for higher approximation orders.

However, the new basis functions pose new algorithmic challenges
as we are usually not able to apply the sparse grid algorithms
that were designed for hat functions.
We learn in this chapter that the main problem is the larger support
of higher-order B-splines (degree $p > 1$) when compared to degree $p = 1$.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to simply ``transform'' the basis
functions $\varphi_{l,i}^p$ to shrink the size of their support
to $\supp \varphi_{l,i}^1$.

In this chapter, we give an overview of algorithms for B-splines
on sparse grids.
Some algorithms are already known from the literature,
while others are new.
In any case, we give correctness results for every algorithm.
We take hierarchization as the example problem for our algorithms,
but the algorithms can be generalized to any linear operator.
Furthermore, most algorithms are not tailored for B-splines $\varphi_{l,i}^p$,
but applicable for general tensor product basis functions $\varphi_{l,i}$.
The types of feasible approaches for algorithms
depend on the ``regularity'' of the sparse grid at hand
(full grid/dimensionally adaptive sparse grid/spatially adaptive sparse grid).
Naturally, the more assumptions the grid satisfies, the faster and
easier will the corresponding algorithms be.

\Cref{sec:41problem} explains hierarchization as our example problem
and defines the notation used in this chapter.
The remaining three sections treat the different cases of grids:
First, \cref{sec:42fullGrids} deals with full grids to formalize and repeat
the well-known unidirectional principle.
Second, \cref{sec:43dimAdaptive} studies algorithms for
sparse grids that have been generated dimensionally adaptively.
Third, \cref{sec:44spatAdaptive} treats the for us most important case
of arbitrary (spatially adaptive) sparse grids.

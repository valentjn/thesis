\chapter{Sparse Grids with Arbitrary Tensor Product Bases}
\label{chap:20sparseGrids}

\todo{Write short intro to SGs? Overlap with Chap. 1?}

This chapter provides a consistent notational framework
for the definition of sparse grids with general basis functions.
The reason not to employ specific bases such as the common hat functions
or B-splines of higher degrees is two-fold:
First, we will define various new ``flavors'' of B-splines,
which is easier if the basis is left open.
Second, most of the statements and theorems that we will make in this
thesis will hold for general basis functions
(in some cases with additional assumptions)
and not just for B-splines.

Besides the derivation of sparse grids with
coarser boundary points in \cref{sec:24boundary},
this section is mostly
a repetition of the definition of sparse grids with general basis functions.
Our notation and presentation will roughly follow
\cite{Pflueger10Spatially} and \cite{Garcke13Sparse}.
A more detailed introduction to sparse grids can be found in
\cite{Bungartz04Sparse}.
Original contributions of the thesis in this chapter
are the formalization of the hierarchical splitting for
arbitrary basis functions in \cref{sec:21nodalSpaces,sec:22hierSubspaces} and
the definition of sparse grids with coarse boundary in \cref{sec:24boundary}.

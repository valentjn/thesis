\chapter{Hierarchical B-Splines and Sparse Grids}
\label{sec:20sparseGrids}

\todo{Write short intro to SGs? Overlap with Chap. 1?}

The aim of this chapter is to define hierarchical B-splines on sparse grids.
It is structured as follows:
\Cref{sec:21sparseGrids} provides a consistent notational framework
for the definition of sparse grids with general basis functions.
The reason not to employ specific bases such as the common hat functions
or B-splines of higher degrees is two-fold:
First, we will define various new ``flavors'' of B-splines,
which is easier if the basis is left open in the basic definitions.
Second, most of the statements and theorems that we will make in this
thesis will hold for general basis functions
(in some case with additional assumptions)
and not just for B-splines for example.
Next, \cref{sec:22bSplines} defines hierarchical B-splines for both
uniform and non-uniform knot sequences.
Finally, we will see in \cref{sec:23boundary} that the boundary behavior
of the classical uniform B-spline basis is problematic.
We will incorporate not-a-knot boundary conditions into the B-spline
basis to mitigate this issue.

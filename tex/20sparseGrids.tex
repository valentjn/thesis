\chapter{Sparse Grids with Arbitrary Tensor Product Bases}
\label{sec:20sparseGrids}

\todo{Write short intro to SGs? Overlap with Chap. 1?}

This section is, besides the derivation of sparse grids with
coarser boundary points in \cref{sec:213boundary},
a repetition of the definition of sparse grids with general basis functions.
Our notation and presentation will follow roughly
\cite{Pflueger10Spatially} and \cite{Garcke13Sparse}.
A more detailed introduction to sparse grids can be found in
\cite{Bungartz04Sparse}.

\addchap{Preface}

Before I start, I want to thank my advisor Prof. Dr. Dirk Pflüger.
It is his ideas and his valuable input that have driven me in
my time as a PhD student.
He truly is a person I look up to!
I am grateful for the exciting time with the whole group of SGS
(Simulation of Large Systems),
for which I want to thank all past and current PhD students and postdocs of
Dirk Pflüger and Prof.\ Dr.\ Miriam Mehl.

Similarly, I thank my co-advisor Prof.\ Oliver Röhrle, PhD, for the
interesting biomechanical collaboration and his willingness to be my co-advisor.
Many thanks go to the other members of the examination board for their
willingness to examine my thesis,
namely \TODO{insert co-examiner} and \TODO{insert co-examiner}.

Probably the most important role for the success of my PhD thesis
has played my family.
Without their mental support and distraction from the daily work,
I doubt that this thesis would have been possible.

Likewise, I am very grateful for the financial support from
the \foreignlanguage{ngerman}{Juniorprofessurenprogramm} of the
\foreignlanguage{ngerman}{Landesstiftung Baden-Württemberg}.
I thank the SimTech Cluster of Excellence for supporting
my three-month research stay in Canberra, Australia.

In addition, I want to thank the open-source community for making it possible to
write this thesis in an aesthetically sophisticated manner.
The list of software that was used to write this thesis includes
\LaTeX, Lua\LaTeX, Bib\LaTeX,
\scalebox{0.9}{\KOMAScript}, Ti\emph{k}Z, Python, Matplotlib,
and many more.

Now, I wish that you, dear reader, obtain as much insight as possible
while reading the remaining
\pagedifference{page:preface}{LastPage} pages of this thesis.

Enjoy!

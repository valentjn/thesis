\chapter{Hierarchical B-Splines and Sparse Grids}
\label{sec:20sparseGrids}



\todo{some glue is missing here}

However, conventional basis functions for sparse grids,
such as the piecewise linear hat function basis $\varphi_{l,i}^1$,
share the downside that they are not continuously differentiable.
This has two important implications.

First, the approximation order of piecewise linear hat functions
is not as high as the higher order of other basis function types,
for examples higher-degree splines.
This issue does not arise for the piecewise polynomial basis
by Bungartz \cite{Bungartz98Finite}.
Second, and this also applies to Bungartz's basis,
we are not able to compute globally continuous gradients of the
interpolant of a smooth objective function.
This is essential in the application of gradient-based optimization,
which we target in this thesis.
In this chapter, we define a hierarchical, higher-order B-spline basis
to obtain both higher-order approximations
and continuous gradients and Hessians.

The aim of this chapter is to define hierarchical B-splines on sparse grids.
It is structured as follows:
\Cref{sec:21sparseGrids} provides a consistent notational framework
for the definition of sparse grids with general basis functions.
The reason not to employ specific bases such as the common hat functions
or B-splines of higher degrees is two-fold:
First, we will define various new ``flavors'' of B-splines,
which is easier if the basis is left open.
Second, most of the statements and theorems that we will make in this
thesis will hold for general basis functions
(in some cases with additional assumptions)
and not just for B-splines.
Next, \cref{sec:22bSplines} defines hierarchical B-splines for both
uniform and non-uniform knot sequences.
Finally, we see in \cref{sec:23boundary} that the boundary behavior
of the classical uniform B-spline basis is problematic,
which is mitigated by incorporating not-a-knot boundary conditions
into the B-spline basis.

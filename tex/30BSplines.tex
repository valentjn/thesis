However, conventional basis functions for sparse grids,
such as the piecewise linear hat function basis $\varphi_{l,i}^1$,
share the downside that they are not continuously differentiable.
This has two important implications.

First, the approximation order of hat functions
is not as high as the order of other basis function types,
for examples higher-degree splines.
This issue does not arise for the piecewise polynomial basis
by Bungartz \cite{Bungartz98Finite}.
Second, and this also applies to Bungartz's basis,
we are not able to compute globally continuous gradients of the
interpolant of a smooth objective function,
if we use non-smooth basis functions.
This is essential in the application of gradient-based optimization,
which we target in this thesis.
In this chapter, we define a hierarchical, higher-order B-spline basis
to obtain both higher-order approximations
and continuous gradients and Hessians.

B-spline basis functions generalize the well-known hat functions.
The first to study B-splines was Schoenberg in 1946,
but he claimed that they had already been known to Laplace.
\newgacronym{fem}{FEM}{Finite element method}%
The possibilities of B-splines were recognized when
the finite element method (\fem),
which is still one of the most significant applications of B-splines,
emerged in the 1960s.
Much important work like finding basic algorithms and proving fundamental
theoretical results was done by de Boor.
B-splines have been applied in various fields:
\fem,
geometric modeling with non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS),
financial mathematics,
molecular and atomic physics,
and other numerous scientific and industrial areas.

The aim of this chapter is to define hierarchical B-splines on sparse grids.
It is divided into two sections:
First, \cref{sec:31standardBSplines} defines hierarchical B-splines for both
uniform and non-uniform knot sequences.
Second, we learn in \cref{sec:32notAKnot} that the boundary behavior
of the classical uniform B-spline basis is problematic,
which is mitigated by incorporating not-a-knot boundary conditions
into the B-spline basis.

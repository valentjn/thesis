However, conventional basis functions for sparse grids,
such as the piecewise linear hat function basis $\varphi_{l,i}^1$
are not continuously differentiable.
This has two implications.

The first implication is that the approximation order of hat functions
is lower than the order of other basis function types
such as higher-degree splines.
The piecewise polynomial basis by Bungartz \cite{Bungartz98Finite}
does not have this issue.
The second implication, which also applies to Bungartz's basis,
is that we cannot compute globally continuous gradients of the
interpolant of a smooth objective function,
if we use non-smooth basis functions.
However, the availability of gradients is
essential in the application of gradient-based optimization,
which we target in this thesis.
In this chapter, we therefore define a hierarchical and
higher-order B-spline basis
(generalizing the well-known hat functions)
to obtain both higher-order approximations
as well as continuous gradients and Hessians.

The first to study B-splines was Isaac Schoenberg in 1946,
but he claimed that they had already been known to Laplace.
Research and industry recognized the possibilities of B-splines when
the \fem, which is still the most significant application of B-splines,
emerged in the 1960s.
Carl de Boor pioneered B-splines, developed basic algorithms, and
proved fundamental theoretical results.
Researchers have applied B-splines in a diverse set of fields such as
\fem and \iga,
geometric modeling with \nurbs,
financial mathematics,
molecular and atomic physics,
and other numerous scientific and industrial areas.

In this chapter, we define hierarchical B-splines on sparse grids.
The chapter is divided into two sections:
First, we define hierarchical B-splines for both
uniform and non-uniform knot sequences in \cref{sec:31standardBSplines}.
Second, we learn in \cref{sec:32notAKnot} that the boundary behavior
of the classical uniform B-spline basis is problematic.
Incorporating not-a-knot boundary conditions into the B-spline basis
mitigates the problems caused by the boundary behavior.

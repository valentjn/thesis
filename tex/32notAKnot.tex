\section{Boundary Behavior of Hierarchical B-Splines}
\label{sec:32notAKnot}

As we have seen in the last section (see \cref{cor:hierSplittingBSpline}),
the hierarchical splitting equation \eqref{eq:hierSplittingUV}
only holds when restricting the function spaces to
$D_l^p = [h_l (p-1)/2,\; 1 - h_l (p-1)/2]$,
which is for $p > 1$ a proper subset of the domain $[0, 1]$.
The implications of this fact on the approximation quality
of the hierarchical B-spline basis are severe.
In this section, we study the underlying reasons of the restriction and
we introduce a new B-spline basis that does not suffer from this issue.



\subsection{Approximation Power of Uniform Hierarchical B-Splines}

Splines are a piecewise generalization of polynomials.
Consequently, approximation spaces spanned by splines of degree $p$ should
at least contain all polynomials of degree $\le p$,
since the approximation power of splines should be at least as good
as that of polynomials.
Unfortunately, this statement is not true for the uniform B-splines
$\varphi_{l,i}^p$ as we have defined them in the last section.
A counterexample is given in \cref{fig:nakInterpolation},
in which a cubic polynomial $f$ is interpolated with
hierarchical cubic B-splines.
However, one can clearly deviations of the interpolant from the polynomial
near the boundary, where the relative error exceeds \SI{10}{\percent}.
The oscillations occur even in the interior of the
spline interpolation domain $D_l^p$.
Of course, this phenomenon does not improve the approximation quality
for other non-polynomial functions as well.

    on the grid of level $l = 3$.%
  }
  \label{fig:nakInterpolation}
\end{figure}

We can explain this as follows:
According to \thmref{cor:hierSplittingBSpline},
we have $S_{\ß\xi_l^p}^p = \bigoplus_{l'=0}^l W_{l'}^p|_{D_l^p}$
with $p = 3$.
Since cubic polynomials as $f$ are cubic splines as well,
$f \in S_{\ß\xi_l^p}^p$ and, consequently,
$f \in \bigoplus_{l'=0}^l W_{l'}^p|_{D_l^p}$.
This means that there is a linear combination of hierarchical B-splines
$\varphi_{l',i'}^p$ ($l' \le l$, $i' \in I_{l'}$)
that interpolates $f$ exactly on the whole domain $D_l^p$
(not be confused with $\tilde{f}$ in \cref{fig:nakInterpolation},
which does not interpolate $f$ exactly in $D_l^p$).
However, in general, this interpolant is not equal $f$ outside
of $D_l^p$ (i.e., in $[0, 1] \setminus D_l^p$),
as \thmref{prop:splineSpace} only holds for $D_l^p$.
In particular, the interpolant evaluated at $x \in \{0, 1\}$ is not
equal to $f(x)$.
If we now force the additional interpolation conditions in
$x_{l,0} = 0$ and $x_{l,2^l} = 1$,
the resulting interpolant $\tilde{f}$ cannot be the same as the previous
interpolant,
which is why $f$ and $\tilde{f}$ differ inside $D_l^p$.

Formally, the unique existence of an interpolating spline is
described by the so-called Schoenberg--Whitney conditions:

\begin{proposition}[Schoenberg--Whitney conditions]
  Let $\ß\xi = (\xi_0, \dotsc, \xi_{m+p})$ be a knot sequence
  and $t_0, \dotsc, t_{m-1}$ a sequence of interpolation points with
  $\xi_p \le t_0 < \dotsb < t_{m-1} \le \xi_m$.
  Then, there exists a unique interpolating spline
  $s = \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} c_k b_{k,\ß\xi}^p$ for arbitrary data if and only if
  \begin{equation}
    \xi_k < t_k < \xi_{k+p+1},\quad
    k = 0, \dotsc, m - 1.
  \end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  See \cite{Hoellig13Approximation}.
\end{proof}

The Schoenberg--Whitney conditions require that the interpolation points
are contained in $D_l^p$.
In the example of $p = 3$ in \cref{fig:nakInterpolation},
the points $0$ and $1$ do not lie in $D_l^p$.
For general degree $p$, the first $(p-1)/2$ and the last $(p-1)/2$
grid points of level $l$ are missing from $D_l^p$,
thus violating the Schoenberg--Whitney conditions.
One possible remedy would be to move these interpolation points inside
$D_l^p$ without changing the corresponding basis functions
(i.e., the knots would stay the same) \cite{Hoellig13Approximation}.
For instance in the cubic case, we could move $0$ and $1$ to
$1.5 h_l$ and $1 - 1.5 h_l$, respectively.
However, with this approach, we would not be able to interpolate
boundary values.
In addition, the condition of the interpolation problem will most likely
worsen if we place interpolation points near the end of the supports
of the corresponding basis functions.

As often, taking slightly a different view of the problem helps
to find a solution.
Let $S_l^p$ denote the space of all splines of degree $p$
on the grid of level $l$, i.e., the space $S_\ß\xi^p$ with
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:fullGridKnots}
  \xi_k := (k - p) h_l,\quad
  k = 0, \dotsc, m + p,\quad
  m := 2^l + p.
\end{equation}
We have $D_\ß\xi^p = [0, 1]$ for this choice of $\ß\xi$, i.e.,
the grid points $x_{l,i}$ ($i = 0, \dotsc, 2^l$) satisfy
the Schoenberg--Whitney conditions for the uniform B-spline basis.
Clearly, the sum $\bigoplus_{l'=0}^l W_l^p$ is a subspace of $S_l^p$,
but it cannot equal $S_l^p$ due to
\begin{equation}
  \dim \bigoplus_{l'=0}^l W_l^p
  = 2^l + 1
  < 2^l + p
  = m
  = \dim S_\ß\xi^p,\quad
  p > 1,
\end{equation}
by \thmref{prop:splineSpace}.
There are too few nodal (and hierarchical) basis functions to
span the whole spline space $S_\ß\xi^p$.

The key idea is now to impose additional $(p - 1)$ boundary conditions
on the basis functions to restrict $S_\ß\xi^p$ to a reasonable subspace
with the correct dimension $(2^l + p) - (p - 1) = 2^l + 1$.
``Reasonable'' means that two requirements should be met:
First, the Schoenberg-Whitney conditions should be satisfied for
the new subspace and the grid of level $l$.
Second, the new subspace should contain all polynomials of degree $\le p$,
eliminating the issue discussed in \cref{fig:nakInterpolation}
in the process.



\subsection{Hierarchical Not-A-Knot B-Splines}

A suitable subspace can be obtained by incorporating the
so-called \term{not-a-knot boundary conditions} into $S_\ß\xi^p$.
For the cubic case $p = 2$,
for which we need two conditions,
the not-a-knot conditions demand that
$\frac{\diff^3}{\dx^3} s$ is continuous at the first and last
interior knot $x_{l,1} = h_l$ and $x_{l,2^l-1} = 1 - h_l$
for all splines $s$ in the subspace.
Equivalently, $x_{l,1}$ and $x_{l,2^l-1}$ are effectively removed from the
knot sequence (hence ``not-a-knot''),
as this is equivalent to requiring that
$s$ is a cubic polynomial on $[0, x_{l,2}]$ and $[x_{l,2^l-2}, 1]$.
For general degree $p$ (in which we need $(p - 1)$ conditions),
we require that the $p$-th derivative $\frac{\diff^p}{\dx^p} s$
is continuous at the first $(p-1)/2$ and the last $(p-1)/2$
inner grid points
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:removedNAKKnots}
  x_{l,i},\quad
  i \in \{1, \dotsc, (p-1)/2\} \cup \{2^l - (p-1)/2, \dotsc, 2^l\},
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to removing these knots from the knot sequence $\ß\xi$.

The knot sequence $\ß\xi_l^{p,\notaknot}$
with not-a-knot boundary conditions is defined as follows:
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{gather}
    \ß\xi_l^{p,\notaknot}
    := (\xi_{l,0}^{p,\notaknot}, \dotsc,
    \xi_{l,m+p}^{p,\notaknot}),\quad
    m := 2^l + 1,\\
    \xi_{l,k}^{p,\notaknot}
    :=
    \begin{cases}
      (k - p) h_l,&
      k = 0, \dotsc, p,\\
      (k - (p+1)/2) h_l,&
      k = p + 1, \dotsc, 2^l,\\
      (k - 1) h_l,&
      k = 2^l + 1, \dotsc, 2^l + p + 1.
    \end{cases}
  \end{gather}
\end{subequations}
This knot sequence $\ß\xi_l^{p,\notaknot}$
can be obtained by removing the knots
given in \eqref{eq:removedNAKKnots} from the
knot sequence \eqref{eq:fullGridKnots} for the full grid of level $l$.
Note that $\ß\xi_l^{p,\notaknot}$ coincides with the
uniform knot sequence $\ß\xi_l,^p$ of \thmref{cor:nodalBSplineSpace}
for the piecewise linear case of $p = 1$.
This is intuitively clear:
For this case,
we do not need to remove any knots as the hierarchical splitting already
holds for the full domain by \cref{cor:hierSplittingHat}.

It is important to observe that the removal of these knots
is only possible if $p + 1 \le 2^l$,
which is equivalent to $l \ge \lceil\log_2(p+1)\rceil$.
For coarser levels,
there are not enough interior knots that could be removed.
Without any special treatment,
we would not be able to obtain enough B-splines to span the spline space.
Therefore,
for definition of \term{hierarchical not-a-knot B-splines}
$\varphi_{l,i}^{p,\notaknot}$ based on \thmref{def:nonUniformBSpline},
we use global Lagrange polynomials for the coarser levels:
\begin{gather}
  \varphi_{l,i}^{p,\notaknot}
  :=
  \begin{cases}
    L_{l,i},&
    l = 0, \dotsc, \lceil\log_2(p+1)\rceil - 1,\\
    b_{i,\ß\xi_l^{p,\notaknot}}^p,&
    l \ge \lceil\log_2(p+1)\rceil,
  \end{cases}\quad
  l \in \NN_0,\quad
  i \in I_l,\\
  L_{l,i}\colon [0, 1] \to \RR,\quad
  L_{l,i}(x)
  := \prod_{\substack{i'=0,\dotsc,2^l\\i'\not=i}}
  \frac{x - x_{i'}}{x_i - x_{i'}}.
\end{gather}
The function $L_{l,i}$ is the $i$-th Lagrange polynomial of level $l$,
that is,
the unique polynomial of degree $\le 2^l$ that interpolates the data
$\{(x_{l,i'}, \delta_{i,i'}) \mid i' = 0, \dotsc, 2^l\}$.
Since its degree $\deg L_{l,i}$ is bounded by $2^l$,
we have $\deg L_{l,i} < p + 1$,
as the Lagrange polynomials are employed only when
$l < \lceil\log_2(p+1)\rceil$.
Due to $2^l$ even (when $l \ge 1$) and $p$ odd,
we can conclude from $\deg L_{l,i} \le 2^l \le p$ that actually
$\deg L_{l,i} \le 2^l < p$
(for $p > 1$; the case $p = 1$, $l = 0$ is the exception).

\section{Homogenization and the Two-Scale Approach}
\label{sec:61homogenization}

We roughly follow the presentation given in
\multicite{%
  Huebner14Mehrdimensionale,%
  Valentin14Hierarchische,%
  Valentin16Hierarchical%
}.



\subsection{Homogenization}
\label{sec:611homogenization}

\paragraph{Density function}

Let $\domain \subset \real^{\dimdomain}$ be the optimization domain.
Usually, we assume $\dimdomain = 2$ or $\dimdomain = 3$,
although the method can be generalized to
arbitrary dimensionalities $\dimdomain \in \nat$.
Shapes and topologies are described by \term{density functions}
$\dens\colon \domain \to \clint{0, 1}$.
The function values $\dens(\tilde{\*x}) \in \clint{0, 1}$ tell if $\tilde{\*x}$
is contained in the object (value of one) or not (value of zero).
The \term{homogenization} approach also allows values between
zero and one, giving the physical density of the material in $\tilde{\*x}$.

\paragraph{Optimization of compliance values}

Furthermore, for every density function $\dens$,
let $\compliance(\dens)$ be an objective function value.
In our setting, which is shown in \cref{fig:topoOptExampleScenario},
we exert a force $\force$ (or multiple forces) on the object,
measure the resulting deformation, and
compute the \term{compliance} (i.e., the inverse of the stiffness) as
the objective function value~$\compliance(\dens)$:
\begin{equation}
  \compliance(\dens)
  = \int_{\domain} \innerprod[2]{\force}{\displacement_{\dens}(\tilde{\*x})}
  \diff\tilde{\*x},
\end{equation}
where the \term{displacement function}
$\displacement_{\dens}\colon \domain \to \real^{\dimdomain}$
depends on the density \cite{Huebner14Mehrdimensionale}.
We want to find the density function
with the minimal objective function value:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:topoOptProblemContinuous}
  \min_{\dens} \compliance(\dens).
\end{equation}
There are often uninteresting trivial solutions,
if we do not impose additional conditions.
For example, when minimizing compliance function values,
choosing $\dens :\equiv 1$
(i.e., filling the entire domain $\domain$ with material)
usually leads to the topology with the
highest stiffness and, thus, the smallest displacement and compliance value.
Therefore, we introduce the following volume constraint:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\voldens{\dens}{\domain}}{\vol{\domain}} \le \densub,\quad
  \voldens{\dens}{\domain}
  := \int_{\domain} \dens(\tilde{\*x}) \diff\tilde{\*x},\quad
  \vol{\domain}
  := \voldens{1}{\domain},
\end{equation}
where $\vol{\domain} = \int_{\domain} 1 \diff\tilde{\*x}$
is the volume of the domain and
$\densub \in \clint{0, 1}$ is an upper bound on the volume fraction.

\subsection{Two-Scale Approach}
\label{sec:612twoScale}

\paragraph{Discretization and two-scale approach}

Of course, we cannot solve the problem \eqref{eq:topoOptProblemContinuous}
numerically,
as there are infinitely many density functions $\dens$.
%To be able to discretize the domain $\domain \subset \real^{\dimdomain}$
%more easily,
For simplicity, we assume that $\domain$ is some hyper-rectangle
$\clint{\tilde{\*a}, \tilde{\*b}}
= \clint{\tilde{a}_1, \tilde{b}_1} \times \dotsb \times
\clint{\tilde{a}_{\dimdomain}, \tilde{b}_{\dimdomain}}$;
if it is not, we can replace $\domain$ with its bounding box.
The domain $\domain$ can then be split into
$M_1 \times \dotsb \times M_{\dimdomain}$
equally sized and axis-aligned sub-hyper-rectangles,
which we call \term{macro-cells}.

In the \term{two-scale approach},
we assume the material of the macro-cells to be
repetitions of infinitesimally small periodic structures
(i.e., identical for each macro-cell),
called \term{micro-cells}.
These micro-cells have a specific shape, which is parametrized by
$d$ \term{micro-cell parameters} $x_1, \dotsc, x_d$.
The parameters are assumed to be normalized to values in the
unit interval $\clint{0, 1}$.
For instance, in two dimensions,
this shape may be an axis-aligned cross of two bars
with thicknesses $x_1$ and $x_2$, as shown in \cref{fig:twoScale}.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{twoScale_1}%
  \caption[%

    \emph{Left:} The domain $\domain$ is subdivided into $M_1 \times M_2$
    macro-cells, each with its own material properties such as density
    \emph{(colors)}.
    \emph{Center:} Every macro-cell is the repetition of infinitesimally small
    periodic micro-cells.
    \emph{Right:} The shape of the structure in every micro-cell is
    described by a micro-cell model with $d$ parameters $x_1, \dotsc, x_d$.
    Here, the micro-cell model is a cross with two parameters
    that represent the thickness of each crossbar.%
  }%
  \label{fig:twoScale}%
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Elasticity tensors}

Note that while the shape of all micro-cells in one macro-cell is identical,
the micro-cell parameters corresponding to different macro-cells differ
in general.
This enables varying densities in different regions of $\domain$.
We denote the parameters of the $j$-th macro-cell
with $\*x^{(j)} = (x_1^{(j)}, \dotsc, x_d^{(j)}) \in
\clint{\*0, \*1} = \clint{0, 1}^d$,
where $j = 1, \dotsc, M$ and
$M := M_1 \dotsm M_{\dimdomain}$ is the number of macro-cells.
With linear elasticity,
one can compute so-called \term{elasticity tensors} $\etensor_j$,
which encode information about the material properties
of the different macro-cells.
The elasticity tensors can be written as symmetric matrices
in $\real^{3 \times 3}$ (for $\dimdomain = 2$) or
in $\real^{6 \times 6}$ (for $\dimdomain = 3$).%
\footnote{%
  In general, the elasticity tensor is a fourth-order tensor in
  $\real^{\dimdomain \times \dimdomain \times \dimdomain \times \dimdomain}$.
  One can reduce the size of the tensor by exploiting various symmetries
  \cite{Huebner14Mehrdimensionale}
  to obtain $6$ or $21$ stiffness coefficients
  in two or three dimensions, respectively,
  which can then be written as a symmetric matrix.%
}
They are usually computed as the solution of a \fem problem
\term{(micro-problem)}.
Once all elasticity tensors $\etensor_j$ are known,
we can compute the compliance value corresponding to the macro-shape
by solving another \fem problem \term{(macro-problem)}.
We refer to \cite{Allaire04Topology} and \cite{Huebner14Mehrdimensionale}
for more details.

\paragraph{Discretized optimization problem}

The new optimization problem following from the
two-scale discretization process has the form
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:topoOptProblemDiscrete}
  \begin{gather}
    \min J(\*x^{(1)}, \dotsc, \*x^{(M)}),\quad
    \*x^{(1)}, \dotsc, \*x^{(M)} \in \clint{0, 1}^d
    \quad\text{s.t.}\quad
    \densmean(\*x^{(1)}, \dotsc, \*x^{(M)}) \le \densub,\\
    \densmean(\*x^{(1)}, \dotsc, \*x^{(M)})
    := \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^M \dens(\*x^{(j)}).
  \end{gather}
\end{subequations}
Here, $\dens(\*x^{(j)}) \in \clint{0, 1}$ is the
density of the $j$-th macro cell with micro-cell parameter $\*x^{(j)}$
(i.e., the fraction of material volume of one micro-cell
with respect to its total volume)
and $\densmean(\*x^{(1)}, \dotsc, \*x^{(M)})$ is the resulting
total mean density.
This discretized optimization problem can now be implemented and
solved numerically.

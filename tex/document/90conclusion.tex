\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:90conclusion}

\noindent
Finally, we conclude the thesis by summarizing its results
and giving an outlook on possible future work.

\paragraph{Summary of the findings}

\todo{highlight advantages and limitations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Chapter 8: model limitations, no inheritance,
  no saving money for housing, \dots
  
  \item
  steal summary table from 18\_odenwald\_opt
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Outlook and future work}

\todo{mention the following future work (not in that order)}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  steal from future work of Milestone Report,
  steal from project description (JP program)
  
  \item
  dimension-wise degree adaptivity
  
  \item
  h-p-adaptivity
  
  \item
  other adaptivity criteria than Novak--Ritter
  (e.g., for constrained optimization)
  
  \item
  other real-world optimization applications
  
  \item
  biomechanical application: more complicated musculoskeletal model
  with more parameters, have to exploit spatial adaptivity
  (was proof of concept)
  
  \item
  finance application: other models such as immediate annuity
  
  \item
  data mining with the new bases
  
  \item
  uncertainty quantification with B-splines on sparse grids
  
  \item
  dimensional adaptivity with the combination technique
  
  \item
  gradient-based approximation/interpolation methods
\end{itemize}

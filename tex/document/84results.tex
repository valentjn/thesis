\paragraph{Parameter values and basis functions}

We use
a risk aversion factor of $\riskav = 3.5$,
a patience factor of $\patience = 0.97$,
a transaction cost rate of $\tac = \SI{1}{\percent}$, and
a minimum consumption of $\normconsume_{\min} = 0.001$.
The bond and stock return rates are taken from \cite{Cai10Stable}.
The models are solved for $T = 6$ time steps;
this number suffices to show all relevant numerical effects and results,
while keeping the computational effort at a reasonable level.
As higher-order B-spline basis functions,
we use the hierarchical weakly fundamental not-a-knot splines
$\bspl[\wfs,\nak]{\*l,\*i}{p}$ of cubic degree $p = 3$
to enable hierarchization with the unidirectional principle.

\paragraph{Software}

The dynamic portfolio choice models were solved using a self-written
MATLAB framework.
The object-oriented framework was designed in such a way that
not only transaction costs problems,
but many other types of dynamic portfolio choice models can be handled.
For instance, the base class \texttt{LifecycleProblem} provides
an interface with abstract functions such as
\texttt{computeTerminalValueFunction} and
\texttt{computeStateTransition}.
The actual functionality implemented in the base class strongly resembles
the algorithms presented in \cref{sec:82algorithms}.
This is not only desirable from a modeling perspective,
but also facilitates future usage by other researchers.
For creating (hierarchization) and evaluating sparse grid interpolants,
the sparse grid toolbox \sgpp was used \cite{Pflueger10Spatially}.%
\footnote{%

}
The emerging optimization problems were solved using
sequential quadratic programming methods supplied by the
NAG Toolbox for MATLAB.%
\footnote{%
  \url{https://www.nag.com/}%
}
Runtimes were measured on a shared memory computer
with 144 threads on 4x Intel Xeon E7-8880v3 (72 cores, 144 threads).

\paragraph{Error measures}

To assess the quality of the resulting value and policy functions,
we use two error measures:
Euler equation error and policy error.
The weighted Euler equation error $\weightedeulererror_t(\normstate_t)$
measures the violation of the first-order optimality conditions,
derived as above.
The policy error is the difference
$\optnormpolicyref_t(\state_t) - \optnormpolicyintp_t(\state_t)$
of the optimal policy to some reference.
Both error measures can be analyzed pointwise or
via their $\Ltwo$ norms, where for the policy error,
we take the mean of the relative $\Ltwo$ error:
\begin{equation}
  \policyerror_t
  := \frac{1}{m_{\policy}} \sum_{j=1}^{m_{\policy}}
  \frac{
    \normLtwo{\optnormpolicyentryref_{t,j} - \optnormpolicyentryintp_{t,j}}
  }{
    \normLtwo{\optnormpolicyentryref_{t,j}}
  }.
\end{equation}
It suffices to consider $t = 0$, as both error measures
usually grow backwards in time due to the dynamic programming approach.



\subsection{Numerical Results}

\paragraph{Reference solution}

We use full grid solutions as reference solutions,
i.e., $\{\state_t^{(k)} \mid k = 1, \dotsc, \ngp_t\} = \fgset{n,d}$
for some fixed level $n \in \nat$ for all $t = 0, \dotsc, T$.
Obviously, this is only computationally feasible
for low dimensionalities $d$ due to the curse of dimensionality.
For each $d$,
\cref{tbl:financeSolutionFullRegularSparseGrids}
(see \cref{chap:a40financeDetails})
contains full grid solutions of different levels,
where the solution with the highest level is used as reference solution.
Unfortunately, only full grid solutions up to $d = 3$ could be computed
due to excessive runtime for $d \ge 4$,
which means that policy errors can only be given for $d = 2$ or $d = 3$.
This underlines the need for sophisticated
discretization techniques such as sparse grids.

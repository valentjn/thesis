\noindent
In the final section of this chapter,
we address implementational details such as employed software and
parameter values and, most importantly, discuss numerical results.

\paragraph{Software}

The dynamic portfolio choice models were solved using a self-written
MATLAB framework.
The object-oriented framework was designed in such a way that
not only transaction costs problems,
but many other types of dynamic portfolio choice models can be handled.
For instance, the base class \texttt{LifecycleProblem} provides
an interface with abstract functions \texttt{computeTerminalValueFunction},
\texttt{computeTerminalPolicy}, \texttt{computeStateTransition}, and so on.
The actual functionality implemented in the base class strongly resembles
the algorithms presented in \cref{sec:82algorithms}.
This is not only desirable from a modeling perspective,
but also facilitates the future usage by other researchers.
For the creation (hierarchization) and evaluation of sparse grid interpolants,
the sparse grid toolbox \sgpp was used \cite{Pflueger10Spatially}.%

The emerging optimization problems were solved using
sequential quadratic programming methods supplied by the
NAG Toolbox for MATLAB.%

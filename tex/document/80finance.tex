\initial[lhang=0.06]{0.1em}{S}{urrogates based on B-splines on sparse grids}
can also be used for our third application,
which stems from mathematical finance.
In this application, we simulate the financial situation of an individual
over their lifetime in discrete time steps or iterations $t = t_0, \dotsc, T$
(for example, years $t = 20, 21, \dotsc, 100$, where $t$ is the age
of the individual).
We track three types of variables:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  \term{State variables}
  such as the individual's wealth or their income
  cannot be controlled directly by the individual.
  Instead, the individual's decisions influence the value of
  state variables of future iterations.%
  \footnote{%
    The time $t$ can also be regarded as a state variable.%
  }
  
  \item
  \term{Policy variables}
  such as consumption or the amount of stocks to buy or sell
  represent the investment decisions the individual can make in
  each iteration.
  They are subject to specific constraints
  (for instance, you cannot spend more money than you have,
  if you do not allow debts).
  
  \item
  \term{Stochastic variables}
  such as the return rates of stocks or the inflation
  cannot be controlled by individual at all.
  Therefore, statements about optimal investment conditions
  are usually made for expected instead of exact values.
\end{itemize}

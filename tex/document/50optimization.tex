\initial{0em}{I}{n this chapter,}
we apply the hierarchical B-spline bases derived in
\cref{chap:30BSplines,chap:40algorithms} to optimization,
which is a major task in simulation technology,
for instance in inverse problems (see \cref{chap:10introduction}).
We pursue a surrogate-based optimization approach:
First, we sample the objective function at specific sparse grid points
to retrieve objective function values.
Second, by interpolating these values with hierarchical bases,
we obtain a surrogate for the objective function.
Finally, we discard the original objective function and apply
already existing optimization methods to the surrogate.
One of the key advantages of hierarchical B-splines
over common hierarchical bases for
sparse grids is their continuous differentiability.
The gradients of B-spline surrogates on sparse grids are not only continuous,
but also explicitly known and can be evaluated fast.
This gives the opportunity to employ gradient-based optimization techniques,
which usually converge significantly faster than gradient-free alternatives.

The outline of this chapter is as follows:
We start in \cref{sec:51algorithms}
with a compact overview of textbook optimization algorithms,
which comprises gradient-free and gradient-based optimization methods
for unconstrained problems as well as algorithms for constrained optimization.
In \cref{sec:52method}, we present the main method that
conflates the various textbook optimization algorithms
to a single method for the optimization of surrogates on sparse grids.
\Cref{sec:53testProblems} continues with a small array of test problems
for unconstrained and constrained optimization.
In \cref{sec:54results}, we apply the presented method
to the test problems, studying the effects of the different
hierarchical B-splines to optimization errors and conducting various
numerical experiments.
Finally, in \cref{sec:55fuzzy}, we examine with the fuzzy extension principle
an example application of optimization of hierarchical B-spline surrogates on
sparse grids.

Parts of this chapter have already been published in previous work
of the author of this thesis \cite{Valentin14Hierarchische}, especially
the overview of optimization algorithms (\cref{sec:51algorithms})
and partly the library of test problems (\cref{sec:53testProblems}).
However, as the previous work included other basis functions as well,
this thesis represents the first comprehensive study
that focuses on the application of hierarchical B-splines to optimization.

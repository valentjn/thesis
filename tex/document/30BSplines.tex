\chapter{Hierarchical B-Splines}
\label{chap:30BSplines}

\initial{-0.05em}{P}{roblematically,}
the piecewise linear ``hat function'' basis $\bspl{l,i}{1}$,
which served in the previous chapter as the motivation
to define sparse grids for arbitrary tensor product basis functions,
is not continuously differentiable.
This has two implications.
First, the approximation order of hat functions
is lower than the order of other basis function types
such as higher-degree splines \cite{Sickel11Spline}
or the piecewise polynomial basis by Bungartz \cite{Bungartz98Finite}.
Second, we cannot compute globally continuous gradients of the
interpolant of a smooth objective function,
if we use non-smooth basis functions%
\footnote{%
  \dots{} which include the hat function basis as well as
  the piecewise polynomials by Bungartz.%
}.
However, the availability of continuous gradients is
crucial in gradient-based optimization,
which we target in this thesis.
In this chapter, we define a hierarchical and
higher-order B-spline basis
as a generalization of the well-known hat functions
to obtain both higher-order approximations
and continuous derivatives.

The first to study B-splines was Schoenberg in 1946
\cite{Schoenberg46Contributions},
but he claimed that they had already been known to Laplace
\cite{Boor76Splines}.
It was also Schoenberg who coined the term ``B-splines'',
which is short for ``basis splines'' \cite{Schoenberg67Spline}.
De~Boor pioneered B-splines, developed basic algorithms, and
proved fundamental theoretical results \cite{Boor72Calculating}.
Research and industry recognized the possibilities of B-splines when
the \fem emerged in the 1960s.
The \fem remains one of the driving forces behind the research of
B-splines \cite{Hoellig03Finite} as the recent rise of \iga shows
\multicite{Cottrell09Isogeometric,Hoellig12Finite}.
Researchers have applied B-splines also in
geometric modeling with \nurbs
\multicite{Cohen01Geometric,Hoellig13Approximation},
financial mathematics \cite{Pflueger10Spatially},
molecular and atomic physics
\multicite{Bachau01Applications,McCurdy04Implementation},
and numerous other scientific and industrial areas \cite{Valentin12Spline}.
Theoretical and practical aspects of B-splines on sparse grids
have also been studied before
\multicite{%
  Pandey08Regression,%
  Pflueger10Spatially,%
  Sickel11Spline,%
  Valentin16Hierarchical%
}.

In this chapter, we define hierarchical B-splines on sparse grids.
The chapter is divided into two sections:
First, we define hierarchical B-splines for both
uniform and non-uniform knot sequences in \cref{sec:31standardBSplines}.
Second, we learn in \cref{sec:32notAKnot} that the boundary behavior
of the standard uniform B-spline basis is problematic.
Incorporating not-a-knot boundary conditions into the B-spline basis
mitigates the problems caused by the boundary behavior.

\Cref{sec:311uniform} is a repetition of the definition
of nodal B-splines \multicite{Hoellig03Finite,Hoellig13Approximation} and
hierarchical B-splines \multicite{Pflueger10Spatially,Valentin14Hierarchische}.
Original contributions of the thesis in this chapter are the proof of
the linear independence of hierarchical B-splines in
\cref{sec:312proofHierarchicalSplitting}
(improved version of \cite{Valentin14Hierarchische},
published in \cite{Valentin16Hierarchical}),
the modified hierarchical Clenshaw-Curtis B-splines in
\cref{sec:314nonUniform} and
the hierarchical not-a-knot B-spline basis in \cref{sec:32notAKnot}.

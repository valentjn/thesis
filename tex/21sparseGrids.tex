\subsubsection{Univariate Case}

Let us first consider univariate functions
that are defined on the unit interval $[0, 1]$.
\newgsymbol{l}{$l$}{Level $\in \NN_0$}%
We discretize this domain by splitting it into $2^l$ equidistant segments,
where $l \in \NN_0$ is the \term{level}.
\newgsymbol{xli}{$x_{l,i}$}{Grid point $:= i \cdot h_l$}%
\newgsymbol{i}{$i$}{Index $= 0, \dotsc, 2^l$}%
\newgsymbol{hl}{$h_l$}{Mesh size $:= 2^{-l}$}%
The resulting $2^l + 1$ \term{grid points} are given by
\begin{equation}
  x_{l,i} := i \cdot h_l,\quad
  i = 0, \dotsc, 2^l,
\end{equation}
where $i$ is the \term{index} and $h_l := 2^{-l}$ is the \term{mesh size}.
\newgsymbol{phili}{$\varphi_{l,i}$}{%
  Hierarchical basis function of level $l$, index $i$%
}%
Every grid point is associated with a \term{basis function}
\begin{equation}
  \varphi_{l,i}\colon [0, 1] \to \RR.
\end{equation}
In this thesis, we assume $\varphi_{l,i}$ to be arbitrary,
satisfying required assumptions when needed and stated.
However, it helps for both the theory and the intuition to have a
specific example of basis functions in mind.
\newgsymbol{phili1}{$\varphi_{l,i}^1$}{Hat function of level $l$, index $i$}%
The most common choice for $\varphi_{l,i}$ are the so-called \term{hat functions}
(linear B-splines), which are defined as
\begin{equation}
  \varphi_{l,i}^1(x)
  := \max(1 - |x/h_l - i|, 0).
\end{equation}
Here and in the following,
the superscript ``1'' is the degree of the linear B-spline and
is not to be read as an exponent.
We will generalize this notation to B-splines $\varphi_{l,i}^p$ of
arbitrary degrees $p$ (see \cref{sec:sgBspl}).

\newgsymbol{Vl}{$V_l$}{Nodal space of level $l$}%
\newgsymbol{span}{$\spn$}{Linear span (set of all linear combinations)}%
The \emph{nodal space} $V_l$ of level $l$
is defined as the linear span of all basis functions
$\varphi_{l,i}$, $i = 0, \dotsc, 2^l$:
\begin{equation}
  V_l := \spn\{\varphi_{l,i} \mid i = 0, \dotsc, 2^l\}.
\end{equation}
We assume that the functions $\varphi_{l,i}$ form a basis of $V_l$, i.e.,
every linear combination of these functions is unique.
\newgsymbol{Vl1}{$V_l^1$}{Nodal piecewise linear space of level $l$}%
In the case of hat functions $\varphi_{l,i}^1$,
the nodal space $V_l^1$ is defined analogously as the span of the
$\varphi_{l,i}^1$ functions.
The space $V_l^1$ is the space of the linear splines,
that is, the space of all continuous functions on $[0, 1]$ that are
piecewise linear polynomials on $[x_{l,i}, x_{l,i+1}]$ for
$i = 0, \dotsc, 2^l - 1$.

\subsubsection{Multivariate Case}

\newgsymbol{d}{$d$}{Dimensionality $\in \NN$}%
For the multivariate case with $d \in \NN$ dimensions,
we proceed with the usual tensor product approach,
for which we replace all indices, points, and functions with
multi-indices, Cartesian products and tensor products, respectively.
\newgsymbol{0!}{$\ß0$}{$(0, \dotsc, 0) \in \NN_0^d$}%
\newgsymbol{1!}{$\ß1$}{$(1, \dotsc, 1) \in \NN^d$}%
\newgsymbol{01!}{$[\ß0, \ß1]$}{%
  Unit hypercube $:= [0, 1]^d$%
}
\newgsymbol{l!}{$\ßl$}{Multivariate level $\in \NN_0^d$}%
Therefore, the domain is now $[\ß0, \ß1] := [0, 1]^d$,
which can be partitioned into
$\prod_{t=1}^d (2^{l_t} + 1)$ equally sized hyper-cubes,
where $\ßl = (l_1, \dotsc, l_d) \in \NN_0^d$ is the $d$-dimensional level.
\newgsymbol{xli!}{$\ßx_{\ßl,\ßi}$}{Multivariate grid point $:= \ßi \cdot \ßh_\ßl$}%
\newgsymbol{i!}{$\ßi$}{Multivariate index $= \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^l$}%
\newgsymbol{i02l!}{$\ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^l$}{%
  For all $\ßi$ with $0 \le i_t \le 2^{l_t}$ for all $t = 1, \dotsc, d$%
}%
The corners of the hyper-cubes are given by the grid points
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:gridPointMultivariate}
  \ßx_{\ßl,\ßi} := \ßi \cdot \ßh_\ßl,\quad
  \ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^{\ßl}.
\end{equation}
In this thesis, relations and operations with vectors (in bold face)
are to be read coordinate-wise, unless stated otherwise.
Bold-faced numbers like $\ß0$ are defined to be the vector $(0, \dotsc, 0)$
in which every entry is equal to that number.
This allows for a somewhat intuitive and suggestive notation.
\newgsymbol{hl!}{$\ßh_\ßl$}{Multivariate mesh size $:= \ß2^{-\ßl}$}%
For example, \eqref{eq:gridPointMultivariate} is equivalent to
\begin{equation}
  \ßx_{\ßl,\ßi}
  := (i_1 h_{l_1},\; \dotsc,\; i_d h_{l_d}),\quad
  i_t = 0, \dotsc, 2^{l_t},\quad
  t = 1, \dotsc, d,
\end{equation}
with the $d$-dimensional mesh size
$\ßh_\ßl := \ß2^{-\ßl} = (h_{l_1}, \dotsc, h_{l_d})$.
\newgsymbol{phili!}{$\varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}$}{%
  Multivariate hierarchical basis function of level $\ßl$, index $\ßi$%
}%
Again, every grid point is associated with a basis function that is defined
as the tensor product of the univariate functions:%
\footnote{%
  Note that one could employ basis functions of different types in
  each dimension, for example B-splines of different degrees.
  For simplicity, we first restrict ourselves to the case of a single type
  for all dimensions, but we will treat the more general case in
  \todo{insert reference}.%
}
\begin{equation}
  \varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}\colon [\ß0, \ß1] \to \RR,\quad
  \varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}(\ßx)
  := \prod_{t=1}^d \varphi_{l_t,i_t}(x_t).
\end{equation}

\newgsymbol{Vl!}{$V_\ßl$}{Multivariate nodal space of level $\ßl$}%
The multivariate nodal space $V_\ßl$ is defined analogously to
the univariate case:
\begin{equation}
  V_\ßl
  := \spn\{\varphi_{\ßl,\ßi} \mid \ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^{\ßl}\}.
\end{equation}
\newgsymbol{phili1!}{$\varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}^1$}{%
  Multivariate hat function of level $\ßl$, index $\ßi$%
}%
\newgsymbol{Vl1!}{$V_\ßl^1$}{%
  Multivariate nodal piecewise linear space of level $\ßl$%
}%
\newgsymbol{ab!}{$[\ßa, \ßb]$}{%
  Hypercube $:= [a_1, b_1] \times \dotsb \times [a_d, b_d]$%
}%
In the case of hat functions $\varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}^1$,
the nodal space $V_\ßl^1$ is the $d$-linear spline space, i.e.,
the space of all continuous functions
on $[\ß0, \ß1]$ that are piecewise $d$-linear polynomial on
all hyper-cubes
\begin{equation}
  [\ßx_{\ßl,\ßi}, \ßx_{\ßl,\ßi+\ß1}]
  := [x_{l_1,i_1}, x_{l_1,i_1+1}] \times \dotsb \times
  [x_{l_d,i_d}, x_{l_d,i_d+1}],\quad
  \ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^\ßl - \ß1.
\end{equation}

We can now interpolate objective functions $f\colon [\ß0, \ß1] \to \RR$
in the nodal space $V_\ßl$.
\newgsymbol{fl!}{$f_\ßl$}{Interpolant of $f$ in $V_\ßl$}%
\newgsymbol{ci!}{$c_\ßi$}{Coefficients of a linear combination}%
A function $f_\ßl\colon [\ß0, \ß1] \to \RR$ is called \term{interpolant}
in $V_\ßl$, if
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:interpFullGrid}
  f_\ßl
  = \sum_{\ßi=\ß0}^{\ß2^\ßl} c_\ßi \varphi_{\ßl,\ßi},\quad
  \fa{\ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^\ßl}{f_\ßl(\ßx_{\ßl,\ßi}) = f(\ßx_{\ßl,\ßi})},
\end{equation}
where $c_\ßi \in \RR$ and
the sum is over all $\ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^\ßl$.
\begin{lemma}[Linear independence of tensor products]
  \label{lemma:tensorProductLinearIndependence}
  The functions $\varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}$ ($\ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^\ßl$)
  form a basis of $V_\ßl$, if the univariate functions
  $\varphi_{l,i}$ ($i = 0, \dotsc, 2^l$)
  form a basis of the univariate nodal space $V_l$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Assume that $c_\ßi \in \RR$ are chosen in \eqref{eq:interpFullGrid}
  such that $f_\ßl \equiv 0$.
  Then for all $\ßi' = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^\ßl$,
  we can evaluate \eqref{eq:interpFullGrid} at $\ßx_{\ßl,\ßi'}$ to obtain
  \begin{equation}
    \sum_{i_1=0}^{2^{l_1}}
    \left(\sum_{i_2=0}^{2^{l_2}} \dotsb
    \left(\sum_{i_d=0}^{2^{l_d}} c_\ßi \varphi_{l_d,i_d}(x_{l_d,i_d'})\right) \dotsb
    \varphi_{l_2,i_2}(x_{l_2,i_2'})\right) \varphi_{l_1,i_1}(x_{l_1,i_1'})
    = 0.
  \end{equation}
  We apply the linear independence in 1D ($x_1$ direction) to conclude that
  the sum over $i_2$ must vanish.
  Repeating this argument for all dimensions, we infer that $c_\ßi = 0$
  for all $\ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^\ßl$,
  implying the linear independence of the functions $\varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}$.
\end{proof}
\newgsymbol{Omegal!}{$\Omega_\ßl$}{Set of full grid points of level $\ßl$}%
The lemma is equivalent to the statement that the coefficients $c_\ßi \in \RR$
exist for every objective function $f$ and are uniquely determined by
the values at the grid points
\begin{equation}
  \Omega_\ßl
  := \{\ßx_{\ßl,\ßi} \mid \ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^{\ßl}\}.
\end{equation}
\newgsymbol{n}{$n$}{Level $\in \NN_0$ of full or sparse grid}
A common choice for the level $\ßl$ is $n \cdot \ß1$ for some $n \in \NN_0$.
\newgsymbol{Vnd}{$V_{n,d}$}{%
  Multivariate nodal space
  $:= V_{n \cdot \ß1}$ of level $n$ with dimensionality $d$%
}
\newgsymbol{Vnd1}{$V_{n,d}^1$}{%
  Multivariate nodal piecewise linear space
  $:= V_{n \cdot \ß1}^1$ of level $n$ with dimensionality $d$%
}
In this case, we replace ``$\ßl$'' in the subscripts with ``$n,d$''
(for example, $V_{n,d} := V_{n \cdot \ß1}$).
\newgsymbol{fnd1}{$f_{n,d}^1$}{Interpolant of $f$ in $V_{n,d}^1$}%
\newgsymbol{||.||L2}{$\norm{\cdot}_{L^2}$}{%
  $L^2$ norm $\norm{f}_{L^2} := \sqrt{\int_\Omega f(x)^2 \dx}$
  for a function $f\colon \Omega \to \RR$%
}
\newgsymbol{O}{$\calO(f(x))$}{Big-$\calO$ Landau notation}%
For the hat function basis $\varphi_{l,i}^1$,
it can be shown that the $L^2$ interpolation error of the interpolant
$f_{n,d}^1$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  \norm{f - f_{n,d}^1}_{L^2} = \calO(h_n^2),
\end{equation}
i.e., the order of the interpolation error is quadratic in the mesh size.

\subsection{Hierarchical Subspaces}

\newgsymbol{dim}{$\dim$}{Vector space dimension}%
\newgsymbol{|.|}{$|\cdot|$}{%
  Absolute value of a scalar or the number of elements of a set%
}%
The dimension of the nodal space $V_\ßl$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dimensionFG}
  \dim V_\ßl
  = |\Omega_\ßl|
  = \prod_{t=1}^d (2^{l_t} + 1).
\end{equation}
\newgsymbol{Omega}{$\Omega(f(x))$}{Big-$\Omega$ Landau notation}%
\newgsymbol{norm1}{$\norm{\cdot}_1$}{1-norm $\norm{\ßx}_1 := \sum_{t=1}^d x_t$}%
In asymptotic terms, this dimension is in $\Omega(2^{\norm{\ßl}_1})$,
where the 1-norm $\norm{\ßl}_1$ of $\ßl$ is defined as
$\norm{\ßl}_1 := \sum_{t=1}^d l_t$.
If we choose the same level $n \in \NN_0$ in all dimensions,
this means that the dimension of $V_{n,d}$ and the
number of grid points grow at least as fast as
$2^{nd} = (h_n^{-1})^d$.
This exponential dependency between $\dim V_{n,d}$ and $d$ is known as the
\term{curse of dimensionality}.
The curse makes interpolation on $V_\ßl$ computationally infeasible
for dimensionalities $d > 4$,
as we would have to calculate and store $\dim V_\ßl$ coefficients $c_\ßi$.%
\footnote{%
  The number of necessary basis evaluations to evaluate the interpolant once
  would not be as large, as most types of basis functions
  (like hat functions $\varphi_{l,i}^1$ and higher-order B-splines)
  are locally supported.%
}

\subsubsection{Hierarchical Splitting in the Univariate Case}

In order to reduce the computational effort,
we first split $V_\ßl$ into smaller subspaces and then identify
which subspaces are most important and which subspaces can be omitted
at the cost of a slightly larger error.
In the univariate case, the key observation is that a grid point of a level $l$
can be written as a grid point of a higher level $l'$:
\begin{equation}
  x_{l,i} = x_{l',i'},\quad
  l' \ge l,\quad
  i' = 2^{l'-l} i.
\end{equation}
\newgsymbol{xor}{$\xor$}{Bitwise ``exclusive or''}%
Conversely, this implies that every grid point $x_{l,i}$ can be uniquely written
as a grid point of a coarser level $l'$ and an odd index $i'$:
\begin{equation}
  x_{l,i} = x_{l',i'},\quad
  l' =
  \begin{cases}
    l - \left[\log_2(\xor(i, i-1) + 1) - 1\right],&l > 0,\\
    l,&l = 0,\\
  \end{cases}\quad
  i' = 2^{l'-l} i,
\end{equation}
% https://mathoverflow.net/a/29973
where $\xor$ is the bitwise ``exclusive or'' function.
The term in brackets is the exponent of the
highest power of two that divides $i$.
\newgsymbol{u!}{$\dotcup$}{%
  Disjoint union of sets (union where the pairwise intersection of
  the joined sets is empty)%
}%
\newgsymbol{Il}{$I_l$}{Set of (odd) indices for hierarchical basis functions}%
This implies that $\Omega_l$ decomposes as
\begin{equation}
  \Omega_l
  = \bigdotcup_{l'=0}^l \{x_{l',i'} \mid i' \in I_{l'}\},\quad
  I_l :=
  \begin{cases}
    \{i = 0, \dotsc, 2^l \mid \text{$i$ odd}\},&l > 0,\\
    \{0, 1\},&l = 0,
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\dotcup$ indicates the disjoint union.
\newgsymbol{Wl}{$W_l$}{Hierarchical subspace of level $l$}%
We call the spaces spanned by the basis functions that correspond to the
joined sets \term{hierarchical subspaces} $W_l$:
\begin{equation}
  W_l
  := \spn\{\varphi_{l,i} \mid i \in I_l\}.
\end{equation}

\newgsymbol{oplus}{$\oplus$}{%
  Direct sum of vector spaces (vector space sum in which the dimension of
  the sum equals the sum of the summands' dimensions)%
}%
For the hat function basis $\varphi_{l,i}^1$ and other basis types,
one can prove that the corresponding nodal space
decomposes into the direct sum of all
hierarchical subspaces of coarser levels or the same level, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:hierSplittingUV}
  V_l
  = \bigoplus_{l'=0}^l W_{l'},
\end{equation}
Here, the direct sum $\oplus$ is
the normal vector space sum with the additional indication
that the dimension of the sum is the sum $\sum_{l'=0}^l W_{l'}$
of the dimensions of the summands
(analogously to $|\Omega_l| = \sum_{l'=0}^l |\Omega_{l'}|$,
where $\Omega_l$ is the disjoint union of the sets $\Omega_{l'}$).
In general, \eqref{eq:hierSplittingUV} may not be true.
The following lemma provides a characterization,
which can be used to prove \eqref{eq:hierSplittingUV} for hat functions.
\begin{lemma}[Hierarchical splitting characterization]
  \label{lemma:hierSplittingUV}
  Equivalent to relation \eqref{eq:hierSplittingUV} is the satisfaction of
  both of the following conditions:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    The hierarchical subspaces $W_{l'}$ ($l' \le l$) are subspaces of $V_l$.
    
    \item
    The basis functions $\varphi_{l',i'}$ ($l' \le l$, $i' \in I_{l'}$)
    are linearly independent.
  \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The first condition is equivalent to $\sum_{l'=0}^l W_{l'} \subset V_l$.
  The second condition is equivalent to
  $\dim \sum_{l'=0}^l W_{l'} = \sum_{l'=0}^l \dim W_{l'}$,
  i.e., to the directness of the sum.
  Therefore, the logical conjunction of both is equivalent to
  $\bigoplus_{l'=0}^l W_{l'} \subset V_l$.
  If the sum is direct,
  the dimension of the sum is equal to $2 + \sum_{l'=1}^l 2^{l'-1} = 2^l + 1$
  (due to $\dim W_{l'} = |I_{l'}| = 2^{l'-1}$ for $l' > 0$ and
  $\dim W_{l'} = 2$ for $l' = 0$),
  which is also the dimension of $V_l$.
  The only subspace of $V_l$ that has the same dimension as $V_l$ is $V_l$ itself,
  so we infer $\bigoplus_{l'=0}^l W_{l'} = V_l$.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
  The hierarchical splitting \eqref{eq:hierSplittingUV}
  holds for the hat function basis.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  The first condition of \cref{lemma:hierSplittingUV}
  is satisfied as piecewise linear splines of level $l'$
  are also piecewise linear splines of higher levels $l \ge l'$.
  The linear independence for the second condition can be proved by induction
  over $l$:
  If a linear combination of $\varphi_{l',i'}^1$ ($l' \le l$, $i' \in I_{l'}$)
  vanishes everywhere, then the coefficients of level $l$ must be zero,
  as otherwise the basis functions $\varphi_{l,i'}^1$ ($i \in I_l$) would
  introduce kinks at $x_{l,i'}$, which the zero function does not have.
  This means that we have a zero linear combination of $\varphi_{l',i'}^1$ for
  $l' \le l - 1$, $i' \in I_{l'}$,
  and by the induction hypothesis, the other coefficients also vanish.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Hierarchical Splitting in the Multivariate Case}

\newgsymbol{Wl!}{$W_\ßl$}{Multivariate hierarchical subspace of level $\ßl$}%
\newgsymbol{Il!}{$I_\ßl$}{%
  Set $:= I_{l_1} \times \dotsb \times I_{l_d}$ of
  (odd) multivariate indices for hierarchical basis functions%
}%
Multivariate hierarchical subspaces of level $\ßl$
are defined analogously to the univariate case:
\begin{equation}
  W_\ßl
  := \spn\{\varphi_{\ßl,\ßi} \mid \ßi \in I_\ßl\},\quad
  I_\ßl
  := I_{l_1} \times \dotsb \times I_{l_d}.
\end{equation}
The splitting \eqref{eq:hierSplittingUV} can now be generalized to the
multivariate case:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:hierSplittingMV}
  V_\ßl
  = \bigoplus_{\ßl'=0}^\ßl W_{\ßl'},
\end{equation}
Again, this relation does not hold in general.
A multivariate counterpart of \cref{lemma:hierSplittingUV} can be used
to prove that \eqref{eq:hierSplittingMV} holds if
the corresponding 1D relation \eqref{eq:hierSplittingUV} holds for all dimensions:
\begin{lemma}[Multivariate hierarchical splitting characterization]
  \label{lemma:hierSplittingMV}
  Equivalent to relation \eqref{eq:hierSplittingMV} is the satisfaction of
  both of the following conditions:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    The hierarchical subspaces $W_{\ßl'}$ ($\ßl' \le \ßl$) are subspaces of $V_\ßl$.
    
    \item
    The basis functions $\varphi_{\ßl',\ßi'}$ ($\ßl' \le \ßl$, $\ßi' \in I_{\ßl'}$)
    are linearly independent.
  \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  If the sum is direct, then its dimension is given by
  \begin{equation}
    \dim \sum_{\ßl'=0}^\ßl W_{\ßl'}
    = \sum_{l_1'=0}^{l_1} \dotsb \sum_{l_d'=0}^{l_d}
    \prod_{t=1}^d \dim W_{l_t'}
    = \prod_{t=1}^d \sum_{l_t'=0}^{l_t} \dim W_{l_t'}
    = \prod_{t=1}^d (2^{l_t} + 1)
    = \dim V_\ßl
  \end{equation}
  using \eqref{eq:dimensionFG}.
  The rest is analogous to the proof of \cref{lemma:hierSplittingUV}.
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}
  If univariate splitting \eqref{eq:hierSplittingUV} holds for every dimension,
  then the multivariate splitting \eqref{eq:hierSplittingMV} holds as well.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  We check the two conditions of \cref{lemma:hierSplittingMV}
  given the two univariate conditions of \cref{lemma:hierSplittingUV}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
    The hierarchical basis functions $\varphi_{\ßl',\ßi'}$
    of $W_{\ßl'}$ ($\ßl' \le \ßl$, $\ßi' \in I_{\ßl'}$) are tensor products
    of functions $\varphi_{l_t',i_t'}$.
    According to the first condition of \cref{lemma:hierSplittingUV},
    each of these functions can be written as a linear combination of
    the nodal basis $\varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}$ ($\ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^\ßl$).
    The tensor product can be expanded to a linear combination
    of tensor products of nodal basis functions.
    Therefore, $\varphi_{\ßl',\ßi'}$ is a linear combination of
    multivariate nodal functions, i.e., $\varphi_{\ßl',\ßi'} \in V_\ßl$.
    As this is true for all $\ßi' \in I_{\ßl'}$, we obtain $W_{\ßl'} \subset V_\ßl$.
    
    \item
    The linear independence of the hierarchical functions $\varphi_{\ßl',\ßi'}$
    ($\ßl' \le \ßl$, $\ßi' \in I_{\ßl'}$) can be shown completely analogously
    to the proof of \cref{lemma:tensorProductLinearIndependence}.\qedhere
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
  The multivariate hierarchical splitting \eqref{eq:hierSplittingMV}
  holds for the hat function basis.\qed
\end{corollary}



\subsection{Sparse Grids}

The idea of sparse grids is to use the
hierarchical splitting \eqref{eq:hierSplittingUV}
to keep only the most ``important'' hierarchical subspaces,
omitting the remaining ones.
There are three main ``flavors'' of sparse grids:
regular, dimensionally adaptive, and spatially adaptive.

\subsubsection{Regular Sparse Grids}

To assess the importance of a subspace, we consider again the
interpolant $f_\ßl \in V_\ßl$ of a function $f\colon [\ß0, \ß1] \to \RR$.
According to the splitting \eqref{eq:hierSplittingUV}, the interpolant can
be written as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:interpHierFullGrid}
  f_\ßl
  = \sum_{\ßl'=0}^\ßl \sum_{\ßi'=\ß0}^{\ß2^{\ßl'}}
  \alpha_{\ßl',\ßi'} \varphi_{\ßl',\ßi'},\quad
  \fa{\ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^\ßl}{f_\ßl(\ßx_{\ßl,\ßi}) = f(\ßx_{\ßl,\ßi})}.
\end{equation}
\newgsymbol{alphali!}{$\alpha_{\ßl,\ßi}$}{%
  Hierarchical surpluses (coefficients of a linear combination of hierarchical
  basis functions)%
}%
The coefficients $\alpha_{\ßl',\ßi'}$ with respect to the hierarchical basis
$\varphi_{\ßl',\ßi'}$ are the \term{hierarchical surpluses}.
When using the hat function basis $\varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}^1$,
one can prove the following representation
for the corresponding surpluses:
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_{\ßl,\ßi}
  = (-1)^d 2^{-\norm{\ßl+\ß1}_1}
  \int_\ß0^\ß1 \varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}(\ßx)
  \frac{\partial^{2d}}{\partial x_1^2 \dotsb \partial x_d^2} f(\ßx) \diff{}\ßx,
\end{equation}
if $\ßl \ge \ß1$ and
$f$ is twice continuously differentiable in every dimension simultaneously,
i.e., $\frac{\partial^{2d}}{\partial x_1^2 \dotsb \partial x_d^2} f$
exists and is continuous.%

  the hypercube $[\ß0, \ß1]$.%

\footnote{%
  The statement is even valid for functions in the Sobolev space
  $H_\mathrm{mix}^2([\ß0, \ß1])$ of with dominating mixed derivative.%
}
This equation provides a direct relation between the hat function surpluses
and the second mixed derivative of the objective function, which has
two consequences.
First, the absolute value of the surpluses will large in regions where
the absolute value of the second mixed derivative is large, i.e.,
where the objective function oscillates strongly.
Second, the surplus will decay with increasing level $\ßl$ as both the factor
$2^{-\norm{\ßl+\ß1}_1}$ and the size of the support of $\varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}$
are decreasing.
As a direct corollary, it can be shown that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:componentEstimation}
  \bignorm{\sum_{\ßi'=\ß0}^{\ß2^{\ßl'}}
  \alpha_{\ßl',\ßi'} \varphi_{\ßl',\ßi'}}_{L^2}
  \le 3^{-d} \cdot 2^{-2 \norm{\ßl}_1} \cdot
  \bignorm{\frac{\partial^{2d}}{\partial x_1^2 \dotsb \partial x_d^2} f}_{L^2}
\end{equation}
for the hat function surpluses $\alpha_{\ßl',\ßi'}$.

Equation \eqref{eq:componentEstimation} motivates to omit those summands
from the sum \eqref{eq:interpHierFullGrid} whose level sum $\norm{\ßl}_1$
exceeds a certain value $n \in \NN_0$.

\newgsymbol{Omegands}{$\Omega_{n,d}^\sparse$}{%

The resulting function space and grid point set
\begin{equation}
  V_{n,d}^\sparse
  := \bigoplus_{\norm{\ßl}_1 \le n} W_{\ßl},\qquad
  \Omega_{n,d}^\sparse
  := \bigdotcup_{\norm{\ßl}_1 \le n}
  \{\ßx_{\ßl,\ßi} \mid \ßi \in I_{\ßl}\}
\end{equation}
are called \term{regular sparse grid (space)} of level $n$.
To better distinguish the different grids,
we call the nodal spaces and grids \term{full grids}.
Although sparse grids have been motivated using the hat function
basis $\varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}^1$,
we generalize the definition to arbitrary bases $\varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}$.
One can prove that for homogeneous boundary conditions
$f|_{\partial[\ß0,\ß1]} \equiv 0$,
the number of required inner grid points
($\ßx_{\ßl,\ßi} \in \Omega_{n,d}^\sparse$ where $\ßl \ge \ß1$)
grows like $\calO(h_n^{-1} (\log_2 h_n^{-1})^{d-1})$, which is much less than
the corresponding number $\calO((h_n^{-1})^d)$ in the full grid case
(see \eqref{eq:dimensionFG}).
In particular, the exponential dependency on the dimensionality $d$
has vanished.
The corresponding $L^2$ error of the sparse grid interpolant
$f_{n,d}^{\sparse,1}$ using hat functions decays
(still assuming homogeneous boundary conditions) like
\begin{equation}
  \norm{f - f_{n,d}^{\sparse,1}} = \calO(h_n^2 (\log_2 h_n^{-1})^{d-1}),
\end{equation}
which is only slightly worse than the full grid error by the factor of
$(\log_2 h_n^{-1})^{d-1}$.

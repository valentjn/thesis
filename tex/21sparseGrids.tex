\subsubsection{Univariate Case}

Let us first consider univariate functions
that are defined on the unit interval $[0, 1]$.
\newgsymbol{l}{$l$}{Level $\in \NN_0$}%
We discretize this domain by splitting it into $2^l$ equidistant segments,
where $l \in \NN_0$ is the \term{level}.
\newgsymbol{xli}{$x_{l,i}$}{Grid point $:= i \cdot h_l$}%
\newgsymbol{i}{$i$}{Index $= 0, \dotsc, 2^l$}%
\newgsymbol{hl}{$h_l$}{Mesh size $:= 2^{-l}$}%
The resulting $2^l + 1$ \term{grid points} are given by
\begin{equation}
  x_{l,i} := i \cdot h_l,\quad
  i = 0, \dotsc, 2^l,
\end{equation}
where $i$ is the \term{index} and $h_l := 2^{-l}$ is the \term{mesh size}.
\newgsymbol{phili}{$\varphi_{l,i}$}{%
  Hierarchical basis function of level $l$, index $i$%
}%
Every grid point is associated with a \term{basis function}
\begin{equation}
  \varphi_{l,i}\colon [0, 1] \to \RR.
\end{equation}
In this thesis, we assume $\varphi_{l,i}$ to be arbitrary,
satisfying required assumptions when needed and stated.
However, it helps for both the theory and the intuition to have a
specific example of basis functions in mind.
\newgsymbol{phili1}{$\varphi_{l,i}^1$}{Hat function of level $l$, index $i$}%
The most common choice for $\varphi_{l,i}$ are the so-called \term{hat functions}
(linear B-splines), which are defined as
\begin{equation}
  \varphi_{l,i}^1(x)
  := \max(1 - |x/h_l - i|, 0).
\end{equation}
Here and in the following,
the superscript ``1'' is the degree of the linear B-spline and
is not to be read as an exponent.
We will generalize this notation to B-splines $\varphi_{l,i}^p$ of
arbitrary degrees $p$ (see \cref{sec:sgBspl}).

\newgsymbol{Vl}{$V_l$}{Nodal space of level $l$}%
\newgsymbol{span}{$\spn$}{Linear span (set of all linear combinations)}%
The \emph{nodal space} $V_l$ of level $l$
is defined as the linear span of all basis functions
$\varphi_{l,i}$, $i = 0, \dotsc, 2^l$:
\begin{equation}
  V_l := \spn\{\varphi_{l,i} \mid i = 0, \dotsc, 2^l\}.
\end{equation}
We assume that the functions $\varphi_{l,i}$ form a basis of $V_l$, i.e.,
every linear combination of these functions is unique.
\newgsymbol{Vl1}{$V_l^1$}{Nodal piecewise linear space of level $l$}%
In the case of hat functions $\varphi_{l,i}^1$,
the nodal space $V_l^1$ is defined analogously as the span of the
$\varphi_{l,i}^1$ functions.
The space $V_l^1$ is the space of the linear splines,
that is, the space of all continuous functions on $[0, 1]$ that are
piecewise linear polynomials on $[x_{l,i}, x_{l,i+1}]$ for
$i = 0, \dotsc, 2^l - 1$.

\subsubsection{Multivariate Case}

\newgsymbol{d}{$d$}{Dimensionality $\in \NN$}%
For the multivariate case with $d \in \NN$ dimensions,
we proceed with the usual tensor product approach,
for which we replace all indices, points, and functions with
multi-indices, Cartesian products and tensor products, respectively.
\newgsymbol{0!}{$\ß0$}{$(0, \dotsc, 0) \in \NN_0^d$}%
\newgsymbol{1!}{$\ß1$}{$(1, \dotsc, 1) \in \NN^d$}%
\newgsymbol{01!}{$[\ß0, \ß1]$}{%
  Unit hypercube $:= [0, 1]^d$%
}
\newgsymbol{l!}{$\ßl$}{Multivariate level $\in \NN_0^d$}%
Therefore, the domain is now $[\ß0, \ß1] := [0, 1]^d$,
which can be partitioned into
$\prod_{t=1}^d (2^{l_t} + 1)$ equally sized hyper-cubes,
where $\ßl = (l_1, \dotsc, l_d) \in \NN_0^d$ is the $d$-dimensional level.
\newgsymbol{xli!}{$\ßx_{\ßl,\ßi}$}{Multivariate grid point $:= \ßi \cdot \ßh_\ßl$}%
\newgsymbol{i!}{$\ßi$}{Multivariate index $= \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^l$}%
\newgsymbol{i02l!}{$\ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^l$}{%
  For all $\ßi$ with $0 \le i_t \le 2^{l_t}$ for all $t = 1, \dotsc, d$%
}%
The corners of the hyper-cubes are given by the grid points
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:gridPointMultivariate}
  \ßx_{\ßl,\ßi} := \ßi \cdot \ßh_\ßl,\quad
  \ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^{\ßl}.
\end{equation}
In this thesis, relations and operations with vectors (in bold face)
are to be read coordinate-wise, unless stated otherwise.
Bold-faced numbers like $\ß0$ are defined to be the vector $(0, \dotsc, 0)$
in which every entry is equal to that number.
This allows for a somewhat intuitive and suggestive notation.
\newgsymbol{hl!}{$\ßh_\ßl$}{Multivariate mesh size $:= \ß2^{-\ßl}$}%
For example, \eqref{eq:gridPointMultivariate} is equivalent to
\begin{equation}
  \ßx_{\ßl,\ßi}
  := (i_1 h_{l_1},\; \dotsc,\; i_d h_{l_d}),\quad
  i_t = 0, \dotsc, 2^{l_t},\quad
  t = 1, \dotsc, d,
\end{equation}
with the $d$-dimensional mesh size
$\ßh_\ßl := \ß2^{-\ßl} = (h_{l_1}, \dotsc, h_{l_d})$.
\newgsymbol{phili!}{$\varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}$}{%
  Multivariate hierarchical basis function of level $\ßl$, index $\ßi$%
}%
Again, every grid point is associated with a basis function that is defined
as the tensor product of the univariate functions:%
\footnote{%
  Note that one could employ basis functions of different types in
  each dimension, for example B-splines of different degrees.
  For simplicity, we first restrict ourselves to the case of a single type
  for all dimensions, but we will treat the more general case in
  \todo{insert reference}.%
}
\begin{equation}
  \varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}\colon [\ß0, \ß1] \to \RR,\quad
  \varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}(\ßx)
  := \prod_{t=1}^d \varphi_{l_t,i_t}(x_t).
\end{equation}

\newgsymbol{Vl!}{$V_\ßl$}{Multivariate nodal space of level $\ßl$}%
The multivariate nodal space $V_\ßl$ is defined analogously to
the univariate case:
\begin{equation}
  V_\ßl
  := \spn\{\varphi_{\ßl,\ßi} \mid \ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^{\ßl}\}.
\end{equation}
\newgsymbol{phili1!}{$\varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}^1$}{%
  Multivariate hat function of level $\ßl$, index $\ßi$%
}%
\newgsymbol{Vl1!}{$V_\ßl^1$}{%
  Multivariate nodal piecewise linear space of level $\ßl$%
}%
\newgsymbol{ab!}{$[\ßa, \ßb]$}{%
  Hypercube $:= [a_1, b_1] \times \dotsb \times [a_d, b_d]$%
}%
In the case of hat functions $\varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}^1$,
the nodal space $V_\ßl^1$ is the $d$-linear spline space, i.e.,
the space of all continuous functions
on $[\ß0, \ß1]$ that are piecewise $d$-linear polynomial on
all hyper-cubes
\begin{equation}
  [\ßx_{\ßl,\ßi}, \ßx_{\ßl,\ßi+\ß1}]
  := [x_{l_1,i_1}, x_{l_1,i_1+1}] \times \dotsb \times
  [x_{l_d,i_d}, x_{l_d,i_d+1}],\quad
  \ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^\ßl - \ß1.
\end{equation}

We can now interpolate objective functions $f\colon [\ß0, \ß1] \to \RR$
in the nodal space $V_\ßl$.
\newgsymbol{fl!}{$f_\ßl$}{Interpolant of $f$ in $V_\ßl$}%
\newgsymbol{ci!}{$c_\ßi$}{Coefficients of a linear combination}%
A function $f_\ßl\colon [\ß0, \ß1] \to \RR$ is called \term{interpolant}
in $V_\ßl$, if
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:interpFullGrid}
  f_\ßl
  = \sum_{\ßi=\ß0}^{\ß2^\ßl} c_\ßi \varphi_{\ßl,\ßi},\quad
  \fa{\ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^\ßl}{f_\ßl(\ßx_{\ßl,\ßi}) = f(\ßx_{\ßl,\ßi})},
\end{equation}
where $c_\ßi \in \RR$ and
the sum is over all $\ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^\ßl$.
\begin{lemma}[Linear independence of tensor products]
  \label{lemma:tensorProductLinearIndependence}
  The functions $\varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}$ ($\ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^\ßl$)
  form a basis of $V_\ßl$, if the univariate functions
  $\varphi_{l,i}$ ($i = 0, \dotsc, 2^l$)
  form a basis of the univariate nodal space $V_l$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Assume that $c_\ßi \in \RR$ are chosen in \eqref{eq:interpFullGrid}
  such that $f_\ßl \equiv 0$.
  Then for all $\ßi' = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^\ßl$,
  we can evaluate \eqref{eq:interpFullGrid} at $\ßx_{\ßl,\ßi'}$ to obtain
  \begin{equation}
    \sum_{i_1=0}^{2^{l_1}}
    \left(\sum_{i_2=0}^{2^{l_2}} \dotsb
    \left(\sum_{i_d=0}^{2^{l_d}} c_\ßi \varphi_{l_d,i_d}(x_{l_d,i_d'})\right) \dotsb
    \varphi_{l_2,i_2}(x_{l_2,i_2'})\right) \varphi_{l_1,i_1}(x_{l_1,i_1'})
    = 0.
  \end{equation}
  We apply the linear independence in 1D ($x_1$ direction) to conclude that
  the sum over $i_2$ must vanish.
  Repeating this argument for all dimensions, we infer that $c_\ßi = 0$
  for all $\ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^\ßl$,
  implying the linear independence of the functions $\varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}$.
\end{proof}
\newgsymbol{Omegal!}{$\Omega_\ßl$}{%
  Set of grid points of the full grid of level $\ßl$%
}%
The lemma is equivalent to the statement that the coefficients $c_\ßi \in \RR$
exist for every objective function $f$ and are uniquely determined by
the values at the grid points
\begin{equation}
  \Omega_\ßl
  := \{\ßx_{\ßl,\ßi} \mid \ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^{\ßl}\}.
\end{equation}
\newgsymbol{n}{$n$}{Level $\in \NN_0$ of full or sparse grid}
A common choice for the level $\ßl$ is $n \cdot \ß1$ for some $n \in \NN_0$.
\newgsymbol{Vnd}{$V_{n,d}$}{%
  Multivariate nodal space
  $:= V_{n \cdot \ß1}$ of level $n$ with dimensionality $d$%
}
\newgsymbol{Vnd1}{$V_{n,d}^1$}{%
  Multivariate nodal piecewise linear space
  $:= V_{n \cdot \ß1}^1$ of level $n$ with dimensionality $d$%
}
In this case, we replace ``$\ßl$'' in the subscripts with ``$n,d$''
(for example, $V_{n,d} := V_{n \cdot \ß1}$).
\newgsymbol{fnd1}{$f_{n,d}^1$}{Interpolant of $f$ in $V_{n,d}^1$}%
\newgsymbol{O}{$\calO(f(x))$}{Big-$\calO$ Landau notation}%
For the hat function basis $\varphi_{l,i}^1$,
it can be shown that the $L^2$ interpolation error of the interpolant
$f_{n,d}^1$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  \norm{f - f_{n,d}^1}_{L^2} = \calO(h_n^2),
\end{equation}
i.e., the order of the interpolation error is quadratic in the mesh size.

\subsection{Hierarchical Subspaces}

\newgsymbol{dim}{$\dim$}{Vector space dimension}%
\newgsymbol{abs}{$|\cdot|$}{%
  Absolute value of a scalar or the number of elements of a set%
}%
The dimension of the nodal space $V_\ßl$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dimensionFG}
  \dim V_\ßl
  = |\Omega_\ßl|
  = \prod_{t=1}^d (2^{l_t} + 1).
\end{equation}
\newgsymbol{Omega}{$\Omega(f(x))$}{Big-$\Omega$ Landau notation}%
\newgsymbol{norm1}{$\norm{\cdot}_1$}{1-norm $\norm{\ßx}_1 := \sum_{t=1}^d x_t$}%
In asymptotic terms, this dimension is in $\Omega(2^{\norm{\ßl}_1})$,
where the 1-norm $\norm{\ßl}_1$ of $\ßl$ is defined as
$\norm{\ßl}_1 := \sum_{t=1}^d l_t$.
If we choose the same level $n \in \NN_0$ in all dimensions,
this means that the dimension of $V_{n,d}$ and the
number of grid points grow at least as fast as
$2^{nd} = (h_n^{-1})^d$.
This exponential dependency between $\dim V_{n,d}$ and $d$ is known as the
\term{curse of dimensionality}.
The curse makes interpolation on $V_\ßl$ computationally infeasible
for dimensionalities $d > 4$,
as we would have to calculate and store $\dim V_\ßl$ coefficients $c_\ßi$.%
\footnote{%
  The number of necessary basis evaluations to evaluate the interpolant once
  would not be as large, as most types of basis functions
  (like hat functions $\varphi_{l,i}^1$ and higher-order B-splines)
  are locally supported.%
}

\subsubsection{Hierarchical Splitting in the Univariate Case}

In order to reduce the computational effort,
we first split $V_\ßl$ into smaller subspaces and then identify
which subspaces are most important and which subspaces can be omitted
at the cost of a slightly larger error.
In the univariate case, the key observation is that a grid point of a level $l$
can be written as a grid point of a higher level $l'$:
\begin{equation}
  x_{l,i} = x_{l',i'},\quad
  l' \ge l,\quad
  i' = 2^{l'-l} i.
\end{equation}
\newgsymbol{xor}{$\xor$}{Bitwise ``exclusive or''}%
Conversely, this implies that every grid point $x_{l,i}$ can be uniquely written
as a grid point of a coarser level $l'$ and an odd index $i'$:
\begin{equation}
  x_{l,i} = x_{l',i'},\quad
  l' =
  \begin{cases}
    l - \left[\log_2(\xor(i, i-1) + 1) - 1\right],&l > 0,\\
    l,&l = 0,\\
  \end{cases}\quad
  i' = 2^{l'-l} i,
\end{equation}
% https://mathoverflow.net/a/29973
where $\xor$ is the bitwise ``exclusive or'' function.
The term in brackets is the exponent of the
highest power of two that divides $i$.
\newgsymbol{u!}{$\dot{\cup}$}{%
  Disjoint union of sets (union where the pairwise intersection of
  the joined sets is empty)%
}%
\newgsymbol{Il}{$I_l$}{Set of (odd) indices for hierarchical basis functions}%
This implies that $\Omega_l$ decomposes as
\begin{equation}
  \Omega_l
  = \mathop{\dot{\bigcup}}_{l'=0}^l \{x_{l',i'} \mid i' \in I_{l'}\},\quad
  I_l :=
  \begin{cases}
    \{i = 0, \dotsc, 2^l \mid \text{$i$ odd}\},&l > 0,\\
    \{0, 1\},&l = 0,
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where the union is disjoint.
\newgsymbol{Wl}{$W_l$}{Hierarchical subspace of level $l$}%
We call the spaces spanned by the basis functions that correspond to the
joined sets \term{hierarchical subspaces} $W_l$:
\begin{equation}
  W_l
  := \spn\{\varphi_{l,i} \mid i \in I_l\}.
\end{equation}

\newgsymbol{oplus}{$\oplus$}{%
  Direct sum of vector spaces (vector space sum in which the dimension of
  the sum equals the sum of the summands' dimensions)%
}%
For the hat function basis $\varphi_{l,i}^1$ and other basis types,
one can prove that the corresponding nodal space
decomposes into the direct sum of all
hierarchical subspaces of coarser levels or the same level, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:hierSplittingUV}
  V_l
  = \bigoplus_{l'=0}^l W_{l'},
\end{equation}
Here, the direct sum $\oplus$ is
the normal vector space sum with the additional indication
that the dimension of the sum is the sum $\sum_{l'=0}^l W_{l'}$
of the dimensions of the summands
(analogously to $|\Omega_l| = \sum_{l'=0}^l |\Omega_{l'}|$,
where $\Omega_l$ is the disjoint union of the sets $\Omega_{l'}$).
In general, \eqref{eq:hierSplittingUV} may not be true.
The following lemma provides a characterization,
which can be used to prove \eqref{eq:hierSplittingUV} for hat functions.
\begin{lemma}[Hierarchical splitting characterization]
  \label{lemma:hierSplittingUV}
  Equivalent to relation \eqref{eq:hierSplittingUV} is the satisfaction of
  both of the following conditions:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    The hierarchical subspaces $W_{l'}$ ($l' \le l$) are subspaces of $V_l$.
    
    \item
    The basis functions $\varphi_{l',i'}$ ($l' \le l$, $i' \in I_{l'}$)
    are linearly independent.
  \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The first condition is equivalent to $\sum_{l'=0}^l W_{l'} \subset V_l$.
  The second condition is equivalent to
  $\dim \sum_{l'=0}^l W_{l'} = \sum_{l'=0}^l \dim W_{l'}$,
  i.e., to the directness of the sum.
  Therefore, the logical conjunction of both is equivalent to
  $\bigoplus_{l'=0}^l W_{l'} \subset V_l$.
  If the sum is direct,
  the dimension of the sum is equal to $2 + \sum_{l'=1}^l 2^{l'-1} = 2^l + 1$
  (due to $\dim W_{l'} = |I_{l'}| = 2^{l'-1}$ for $l' > 0$ and
  $\dim W_{l'} = 2$ for $l' = 0$),
  which is also the dimension of $V_l$.
  The only subspace of $V_l$ that has the same dimension as $V_l$ is $V_l$ itself,
  so we infer $\bigoplus_{l'=0}^l W_{l'} = V_l$.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
  The hierarchical splitting \eqref{eq:hierSplittingUV}
  holds for the hat function basis.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  The first condition of \cref{lemma:hierSplittingUV}
  is satisfied as piecewise linear splines of level $l'$
  are also piecewise linear splines of higher levels $l \ge l'$.
  The linear independence for the second condition can be proved by induction
  over $l$:
  If a linear combination of $\varphi_{l',i'}^1$ ($l' \le l$, $i' \in I_{l'}$)
  vanishes everywhere, then the coefficients of level $l$ must be zero,
  as otherwise the basis functions $\varphi_{l,i'}^1$ ($i \in I_l$) would
  introduce kinks at $x_{l,i'}$, which the zero function does not have.
  This means that we have a zero linear combination of $\varphi_{l',i'}^1$ for
  $l' \le l - 1$, $i' \in I_{l'}$,
  and by the induction hypothesis, the other coefficients also vanish.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Hierarchical Splitting in the Multivariate Case}

\newgsymbol{Wl!}{$W_\ßl$}{Multivariate hierarchical subspace of level $\ßl$}%
\newgsymbol{Il!}{$I_\ßl$}{%
  Set $:= I_{l_1} \times \dotsb \times I_{l_d}$ of
  (odd) multivariate indices for hierarchical basis functions%
}%
Multivariate hierarchical subspaces of level $\ßl$
are defined analogously to the univariate case:
\begin{equation}
  W_\ßl
  := \spn\{\varphi_{l,i} \mid \ßi \in I_\ßl\},\quad
  I_\ßl
  := I_{l_1} \times \dotsb \times I_{l_d}.
\end{equation}
The splitting \eqref{eq:hierSplittingUV} can now be generalized to the
multivariate case:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:hierSplittingMV}
  V_\ßl
  = \bigoplus_{\ßl'=0}^\ßl W_{\ßl'},
\end{equation}
Again, this relation does not hold in general.
A multivariate counterpart of \cref{lemma:hierSplittingUV} can be used
to prove that \eqref{eq:hierSplittingMV} holds if
the corresponding 1D relation \eqref{eq:hierSplittingUV} holds for all dimensions:
\begin{lemma}[Multivariate hierarchical splitting characterization]
  \label{lemma:hierSplittingMV}
  Equivalent to relation \eqref{eq:hierSplittingMV} is the satisfaction of
  both of the following conditions:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    The hierarchical subspaces $W_{\ßl'}$ ($\ßl' \le \ßl$) are subspaces of $V_\ßl$.
    
    \item
    The basis functions $\varphi_{\ßl',\ßi'}$ ($\ßl' \le \ßl$, $\ßi' \in I_{\ßl'}$)
    are linearly independent.
  \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  If the sum is direct, then its dimension is given by
  \begin{equation}
    \dim \sum_{\ßl'=0}^\ßl W_{\ßl'}
    = \sum_{\mathclap{l_1'=0}}^{l_1} \dotsb \sum_{\mathclap{l_d'=0}}^{l_d} \prod_{t=1}^d \dim W_{l_t'}
    = \prod_{t=1}^d \sum_{\mathclap{l_t'=0}}^{l_t} \dim W_{l_t'}
    = \prod_{t=1}^d (2^{l_t} + 1)
    = \dim V_\ßl
  \end{equation}
  by \eqref{eq:dimensionFG}.
  The rest is analogous to the proof of \cref{lemma:hierSplittingUV}.
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}
  If univariate splitting \eqref{eq:hierSplittingUV} holds for every dimension,
  then the multivariate splitting \eqref{eq:hierSplittingMV} holds as well.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  We check the two conditions of \cref{lemma:hierSplittingMV}
  given the two univariate conditions of \cref{lemma:hierSplittingUV}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
    The hierarchical basis functions $\varphi_{\ßl',\ßi'}$
    of $W_{\ßl'}$ ($\ßl' \le \ßl$, $\ßi' \in I_\ßl'$) are tensor products
    of functions $\varphi_{l_t',i_t'}$.
    According to the first condition of \cref{lemma:hierSplittingUV},
    each of these functions can be written as a linear combination of
    the nodal basis $\varphi_{\ßl,\ßi}$ ($\ßi = \ß0, \dotsc, \ß2^\ßl$).
    The tensor product can be expanded to a linear combination
    of tensor products of nodal basis functions.
    Therefore, $\varphi_{\ßl',\ßi'}$ is a linear combination of
    multivariate nodal functions, i.e., $\varphi_{\ßl',\ßi'} \in V_\ßl$.
    As this is true for all $\ßi' \in I_\ßl'$, we obtain $W_\ßl' \subset V_\ßl$.
    
    \item
    The linear independence of the hierarchical functions $\varphi_{\ßl',\ßi'}$
    ($\ßl' \le \ßl$, $\ßi' \in I_{\ßl'}$) can be shown completely analogously
    to the proof of \cref{lemma:tensorProductLinearIndependence}.\qedhere
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
  The multivariate hierarchical splitting \eqref{eq:hierSplittingMV}
  holds for the hat function basis.\qed
\end{corollary}

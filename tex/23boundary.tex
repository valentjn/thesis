\section{Boundary Behavior of Hierarchical B-Splines}
\label{sec:23boundary}

As we have seen in the last section (see \cref{cor:hierSplittingBSplines}),
the hierarchical splitting equation \eqref{eq:hierSplittingUV}
only holds when restricting the function spaces to
$D_l^p = [h_l (p-1)/2,\; 1 - h_l (p-1)/2]$,
which is for $p > 1$ a proper subset of the domain $[0, 1]$.
The implications of this fact on the approximation quality
of the hierarchical B-spline basis are severe.
In this section, we study the underlying reasons of the restriction and
we introduce a new B-spline basis that does not suffer from this issue.



\subsection{Approximation Power of Uniform Hierarchical B-Splines}

Splines are a piecewise generalization of polynomials.
Consequently, approximation spaces spanned by splines of degree $p$ should
at least contain all polynomials of degree $\le p$,
since the approximation power of splines should be at least as good
as that of polynomials.
Unfortunately, this statement is not true for the uniform B-splines
$\varphi_{l,i}^p$ as we have defined them in the last section.
A counterexample is given in \cref{fig:nakInterpolation},
in which a cubic polynomial $f$ is interpolated with
hierarchical cubic B-splines.
However, one can clearly deviations of the interpolant from the polynomial
near the boundary, where the relative error exceeds \SI{10}{\percent}.
The oscillations occur even in the interior of the
spline interpolation domain $D_l^p$.
Of course, this phenomenon does not improve the approximation quality
for other non-polynomial functions as well.

    on the grid of level $l = 3$.%

  \label{fig:nakInterpolation}
\end{figure}

We can explain this as follows:
According to \thmref{cor:hierSplittingBSplines},
we have $S_{\ß\xi_l^p}^p = \bigoplus_{l'=0}^l W_{l'}^p|_{D_l^p}$
with $p = 3$.
Since cubic polynomials as $f$ are cubic splines as well,
$f \in S_{\ß\xi_l^p}^p$ and, consequently,
$f \in \bigoplus_{l'=0}^l W_{l'}^p|_{D_l^p}$.
This means that there is a linear combination of hierarchical B-splines
$\varphi_{l',i'}^p$ ($l' \le l$, $i' \in I_{l'}$)
that interpolates $f$ exactly on the whole domain $D_l^p$
(not be confused with $\tilde{f}$ in \cref{fig:nakInterpolation},
which does not interpolate $f$ exactly in $D_l^p$).
However, in general, this interpolant is not equal $f$ outside
of $D_l^p$ (i.e., in $[0, 1] \setminus D_l^p$),
as \thmref{prop:splineSpace} only holds for $D_l^p$.
In particular, the interpolant evaluated at $x \in \{0, 1\}$ is not
equal to $f(x)$.
If we now force the additional interpolation conditions in
$x_{l,0} = 0$ and $x_{l,2^l} = 1$,
the resulting interpolant $\tilde{f}$ cannot be the same as the previous
interpolant,
which is why $f$ and $\tilde{f}$ differ inside $D_l^p$.

Formally, the unique existence of an interpolating spline is
described by the so-called Schoenberg--Whitney conditions:

\begin{proposition}[Schoenberg--Whitney conditions]
  Let $\ß\xi = (\xi_0, \dotsc, \xi_{m+p})$ be a knot sequence
  and $t_0, \dotsc, t_{m-1}$ a sequence of interpolation points with
  $\xi_p \le t_0 < \dotsb < t_{m-1} \le \xi_m$.
  Then, there exists a unique interpolating spline
  $s = \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} c_k b_{k,\ß\xi}^p$ for arbitrary data if and only if
  \begin{equation}
    \xi_k < t_k < \xi_{k+p+1},\quad
    k = 0, \dotsc, m - 1.
  \end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  See \cite{Hoellig13Approximation}.
\end{proof}

The Schoenberg--Whitney conditions require that the interpolation points
are contained in $D_l^p$.
In the example of $p = 3$ in \cref{fig:nakInterpolation},
the points $0$ and $1$ do not lie in $D_l^p$.
For general degree $p$, the first $(p-1)/2$ and the last $(p-1)/2$
grid points of level $l$ are missing from $D_l^p$,
thus violating the Schoenberg--Whitney conditions.
One possible remedy would be to move these interpolation points inside
$D_l^p$ without changing the corresponding basis functions
(i.e., the knots would stay the same) \cite{Hoellig13Approximation}.
For instance in the cubic case, we could move $0$ and $1$ to
$1.5 h_l$ and $1 - 1.5 h_l$, respectively.
However, with this approach, we would not be able to interpolate
boundary values.
In addition, the condition of the interpolation problem will most likely
worsen if we place interpolation points near the end of the supports
of the corresponding basis functions.

As often, taking slightly a different view of the problem helps
to find a solution.
Let $S_l^p$ denote the space of all splines of degree $p$
on the grid of level $l$, i.e., the space $S_\ß\xi^p$ with
\begin{equation}
  \xi_k := (k - p) h_l,\quad
  k = 0, \dotsc, m + p,\quad
  m := 2^l + p.
\end{equation}
We have $D_\ß\xi^p = [0, 1]$ for this choice of $\ß\xi$, i.e.,
the grid points $x_{l,i}$ ($i = 0, \dotsc, 2^l$) satisfy
the Schoenberg--Whitney conditions for the uniform B-spline basis.
Clearly, $\bigoplus_{l'=0}^l W_l^p$ is a subspace of $S_l^p$,
but it cannot equal $S_l^p$ due to
\begin{equation}
  \dim \bigoplus_{l'=0}^l W_l^p
  = 2^l + 1
  < 2^l + p
  = m
  = \dim S_\ß\xi^p,\quad
  p > 1,
\end{equation}
by \thmref{prop:splineSpace}.
There are too few nodal (and hierarchical) basis functions to
span the whole spline space $S_\ß\xi^p$.

The key idea is now to impose additional $(p - 1)$ boundary conditions
on the basis functions to restrict $S_\ß\xi^p$ to a reasonable subspace
with the correct dimension $(2^l + p) - (p - 1) = 2^l + 1$.
``Reasonable'' means that two requirements should be met:
First, the Schoenberg-Whitney conditions should be satisfied for
the new subspace and the grid of level $l$.
Second, the new subspace should contain all polynomials of degree $\le p$,
eliminating the issue discussed in \cref{fig:nakInterpolation}
in the process.
